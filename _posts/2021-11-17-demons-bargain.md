Saniya blocked the attack and countered with her punch shattering a rib. The man fell to his knees, "I'm sorry Saniya," he whimpered, "Please. Don't hurt me." he begged.

"You filthy piece of shit," Saniya spat, "You abducted a little girl and raped her. You want my forgiveness?" Saniya crouched next to him and pulled his hair.

"Please," the fallen man said. A small crowd had burgeoned and were watching with curiosity, "Please, don't hurt me." he said. Saniya scoffed and punched him under his eyes, blackening the skin. The man screamed in agony as Saniya stripped him off his clothes and dragged him through the streets. She flung the door of the nearest police station and dumped the man inside.

"Who is this?" the captain walked up to her with his hands resting on his gun. He was tall and muscular, with a dark complexion and fiery green eyes that contrasted his cold attitude.

"Another one who tried to rape a girl," Saniya said. She stalked closer with an angry, contorted face, "I'm cleaning up the streets for you. You are supposed to protect people from these dreadful incidents."

Captain looked at her from head to toe and measured her, "Be careful with your tone Saniya. I don't have enough men."

Saniya narrowed her eyes and scoffed, "You all are a worthless piece of crap." She turned and exited the building. Outside, the sun had lowered in the sky, hiding behind the tall towers. Long shadows plunged the city into the darkness-- sapping her energy. Saniya looked over her shoulders with anxiety and fear. She looked at her watch and realized it was getting late, and she dashed through the snaking roads of the city. 

"It is almost time." she thought as she opened the doors of her apartment, "It'll start soon." she thought, closing the door behind her shut. 

She remembered the day when she had bargained with her internal demons, "Are you sure this is what you want? Super strength?" he demons cackled.

"Yes," Saniya said, "I'll not let anyone suffer from what I had."

"You'll have to re-live that day over and over and over and over again. Are you sure you can handle it?" the demons asked.

"Yes." she said, "I'll protect those who cannot protect themselves."

She turned on the lights to keep the growing darkness and fear away, but she knew nothing could stop what was coming. She could hear footsteps approaching her. She could feel cold, lustful eyes following her. She called for help, but her words choked in her throat. 

Dropping to her knees, she crawled to a corner and placed her face deep between her thighs, "Please, no!" she wanted to scream, "Mom, please no! Help me, mom!" she saw her mother hovering at the door, exchanging heated words with two men who had come knocking, "Please don't let them hurt me." Saniya begged.

The men approached her with an evil smile and lifeless eyes filled with lust. Saniya looked at her mother, who found it difficult to stay straight-- the heroin had taken her. The men undid their pants and kneeled next to her. 

Saniya closed her eyes and her mind, she wanted to scream, but only tears came. The men took turns abusing Saniya while her mother looked at them with red eyes and a vacant smile. "I can give you two more days with her." her mother said, "I want more of this." she banged her fingers against the needle.

The atrocities lasted-- for what felt like an eternity-- leaving her broken. Saniya could barely feel anything, her mind was numb, and her body was just a lump of flesh and bones.
