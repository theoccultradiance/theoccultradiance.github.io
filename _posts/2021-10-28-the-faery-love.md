Prompt: 
A fey is trapped in the human realm and is forced to navigate incomprehensible rituals and laws in a world where even time doesn't make sense

Nimbus pulled at his matted golden locks. "Ugh." he was lost-- stuck in the human realm and he missed his family. Nimbus looked peeked from behind a door and saw humans bustling to reach somewhere. 

He his beat furiously in his chest as he tried to keep himself from panicking, *It's okay.* he thought, *Even thought the world moved at a much faster pace, I can slow the time down.* He looked over his shoulders and found himself standing alone in room. He snapped his fingers together and peeked through the small opening with hopeful eyes. *Snap* he tried again, the humans seemed to move at the same, scary pace.

Nimbus pulled at his golden locks again. Tears swelled in his eyes as he kneeled behind the closed door. He missed his family-- his wife Iris, his daughter Nyphadora. They were waiting for him to return home with apples from the human realm. He picked up the bag of apples and hugged them tight as if holding her daughter Nyphadora. *Dora.* 

His tears had dried, the sun had set but the humans moved in a hurry to be somewhere. Nimbus got to his feet holding the bag of apples and pulled the door open and went into the street. *I can never go home.* he thought. He stood motionless in the middle of the street and humans passing by shouted angrily at him but he didn't understand what they said-- he didn't know their language. Someone pushed him to the side against a brick wall that reminded him of his home. 

*I can never go home.* he thought and another stream of tears began to flow down his cheeks. Nimbus wiped the tears off his cheeks but they just wouldn't stop. The only portal that connected the Fae to the human realm was destroyed leaving him lost in an incomprehensible world.

Time seemed to flow differently in the human world, back at home Nimbus could go back to his past or into his future as he wished. He could even stop time if he wanted to savor a moment, but here time was absolute, it flowed in only one direction. He had learnt it the hard way.

*why are they always in a hurry?* Nimbus thought on his way from the factory as he matched the pace of the human flow. He took a turn and found himself swaying in the turbulent flow of humans buying and selling. 

*Money is such a weird concept!* Nimbus thought playing with the coins in his pocket. He moved with the current of people around him cutting a way for himself towards a fruit seller near the water fountain.

"A bag of apples please." Nimbus had learnt the human tongue, although his accent was a little difficult to understand. 

"You aren't from around?" the fruit seller said as picked some red apples and gently placed them in a bag. 

"No." Nimbus said with a heavy heart, "But this is my home now."

"Welcome to the city." the fruit seller said. *I've been in this city for over 10 years now* he thought to himself as he took the bag from him. *Happy Birthday Dora.* he thought as he continued to follow the strong current of human commotion. 

He took out and apple and bit into it. When across the busy market he saw something, a golden light. He adjusted his path and cut towards the light. The light moved and he chased it. *What is that?* he thought biting into the apple. 

After chasing it for a few minutes around the market he finally saw a woman -- a faery. Her eyes were filled with tears as she tried to comprehend the incomprehensible. She looked lost-- like he had been ten years ago. His heart sank for the lost soul and he started towards her.

"Hello." he spoke in Fae. 

"Hello." the woman eyes widened and after a moment she gave him the most beautiful smile he had seen in ages, "Oh thank Mother Fae." the woman said in voice sweet as honey. 

"I'm Nimbus." he offered her an apple from the bag.

"I'm Lula." Nimbus looked at her green eyes and realised he had fallen in love. He leaned in placed his mouth on her and kissed her. *The rules of the Fae are so simple. You act before you court.* Lula kissed him back.

"I'm so glad to meet another Fae." Lula said, "I've been stuck in the Human world for over 10 years now."

Nimbus smiled as he held her hand and led her through the turbulence of human life.
