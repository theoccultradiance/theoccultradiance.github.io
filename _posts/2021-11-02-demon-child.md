Sebastian found his mom cut in half when he walk into the old apartment. He couldn't fathom what his loss-- his mind had created a wall to protect him. But he felt a rage-- icy and bone chilling-- rise inside him. He picked her mother's upper half and cradled her, holding back tears that pushed against him, cracking the wall he had raised. 

*Son,* he heard her mother's voice and for a moment thought this was all just a bad dream, *We should always forgive people. Especially the ones who want to hurt us.* He trembling voice calmed his rage, but he had loved her and losing her shattered his world. He looked around the apartment and saw writing on the wall. *Fiend's Whore.* something snapped inside him. His mother's voice grew distant and a terrible rage filled him.

He picked her mother's halved corpse placed it in the center of the room lit the apartment with just a thought in his head. The dancing flame swallowed his childhood and his memories of running around the room being chased by his mother. *They'll pay.* he thought to himself. He watched the apartment burn the fire fighters struggling to keep the magical flame under control, *Kill them. Kill them all.* a voice-- not his own called and he nodded to himself.

*What has god taught us?* his mother asked, *Forgiveness is the holiest virtue.* he turned and broke into a lonely walk. 

*The God didn't lose his mother.* he thought to himself. He stopped by a shop selling televisions and saw them-- the heroes-- the protecters of the city talking gleefully to the interviewer. The rage he had been holding back surfaced. It wasn't like a red hot fire that burnt too quickly. No, it wasn't even icy that chilled you to bones and reminded you that it was still inside you. No. It was like the sky on a moonless night-- dark, endless and gigantic. He turned away from the televisions and walked. He knew where the murderers were. 

*You are demon.* a voice laughed inside him, *You mother wanted you to be a religious peasant.* Sebastian listened to the voice but he didn't care what it said the black rage drove him, *You are a piece of me. My seed. You are the Prince of Hell.* the voice laughed, *Show them what you can do.*

*Son,* his mother's voice said, *Let this pain go, Son. Rage is like a match, you hold it long enough and it'll hurt you.* 

Sebastian broke the door with a single kick, the heroes rose-- almost at the same time. The room was sent in a chaos as the murderers instructed the ordinary citizens to safety. "Demon Bastard." one of them called. But he didn't care. The murderers formed a circle around him, falling into a fighting stance, wielding salted weapons and silver daggers. The murderers closed the circle around him, *Son,* his mother voice was suppressed by the evil laugh. *Show them who you truly our.* the voice of his father echoed-- he had never known he was a child of the Devil himself.

The murderers attacked in a complete symphony. Sebastian instinctively moved and punched an attacker cracking his skull. He jumped in place and broke the leg of the attacker who taught of throwing a low kick. *Kill the head.* the voice of his father echoed and he looked around for the leader of the group. A tall, slender woman with dirty blonde hair and a dark skin that contrasted her blue eyes stood calmly. She looked her eyes with his, "Demon." she said calmly.

Sebastian walked towards her dodging blows of the murderers. The Blonde murderer pulled her sword and prepared herself for an attack. Sebastian closed the gap between them and she stabbed him when he was within her range. A fear filled the murderer's blue eyes as Sebastian didn't break his gait and held her by throat. The silver sword punctured through his heart and came out from back. He lifted her up with ease and punched her-- breaking her nose and her teeth. The other murderers attacked him-- stabbing him various weapons-- but he didn't loosen his grip around the blue eyed woman.

"You killed my mother." Sebastian said as he landed a punch in her gut.

"She was a Whore." the woman strained, "She connsumated with the devil."

"She was a gentle woman." Sebastian said, "She never hurt a fly." he punched her sides and cracked a few ribs.

"She harbored you." the woman said, "A demon."

*Son.* his mother's voice echoed over his father's laughter, *If you kill this woman-- it'll prove them right. You maybe the Prince of Hell. But you are my Sebastian. Let the rage go.* 

Sebastian looked at the blonde woman, "If you kill another in the name of God my mother worshipped, I'll find you and I'll rip you from limb to limb. I'm the Prince of Hell and you are alive because my mother taught well." he dropped the woman and walked out of the door with knives, swords and stuff jutting from his body like octopuses tentacles.
