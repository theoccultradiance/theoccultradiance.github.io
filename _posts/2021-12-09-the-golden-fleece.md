Pre Draft:
"I accept it," I said to the first mate without looking up from the map, "You were correct, Jay, we are lost." I caught Jay shaking his head. I tried to decipher the map but it had stopped making sense a long time ago.

"What should we do?" Jay asked, pouring himself a glass of rum, "Hmm, this tastes nasty. We should purchase more of this when we make port." 

"Jay," I threw the map in a corner and looked up from behind my desk, "Let's get on the deck, I've been inside for a long time."

"Good idea, Kora." he grimaced drinking the nasty rum. I had tried it once and it sent pulses of shock throughout my body. Stretching my back, I follow Jay out on the deck. It was quiet and the boat rocked steadily as we drifted aimlessly under a starry sky. I took a long deep breath of wet, briny air and was immediately filled with raw electric power that pushed the dull aches of my bones away. 

"Here." Jay offered a glass, "This will help you open your mind up." 

I reluctantly wrap my fingers around the cold glass and take a sip of the nasty, brown liquid. The rum burnt a hole inside me as it quickly dripped down my throat. "How can you drink this shit?" I throw myself against the starboard and lose myself in the starry night. 

My mind wandered back to the day when I had furiously left my home, challenging my father, "I'm going to find the Golden Fleece," I shouted at him as I stuffed all my belongings in a sack, "I'm going to find that fucking Golden Fleece and be the Queen." After seeing how inadequate my father was, I wanted to be the queen to save my people, "If only I can find the Golden Fleece... I could bring prosperity to my people."

My eyes grew heavy from the rocking ship and gentle, briny breeze, "If only the yellow light pointed me towards the Golden Fleece..." I found myself wondering when I saw a speck of light move amongst a billion stars. I jolted up and pointed towards the speck of light that was fading quickly, "Jay."

"What is that?"

"Let's go, Jay." I lead jay back to the bridge and table the tattered map, "Follow the golden light." A big smile broke my lips and I sounded the horn and pushed the ship into frantic activity.

"You take the helm, Jay," I order as I start charting a route on the map, "The light moved Northwest, turn the ship portside and keep her straight."

"What is that?" I asked Jay, "Do you see that?" I handed him the telescope tapping my fingers against the taffrail impatiently. If it was the island, I was soon going to be a queen. I could finally do what my father couldn't bring the Golden Fleece back where it belonged. Jay lowered the telescope and nodded. 

"It is."

As the island neared, I saw the blue sky fill with a golden glow. Birds flocked towards the island and circled just above it in perfect harmony. Slowly I smelled the sweet fragrance of lilies and tulip carry over with the wind that blew against us. Brine and lilies made an oddly good combination and I took in as much as I can. My heart was racing and the gentle pitch of the ship calmed me, "It is finally happening." 

The land was finally visible the light brown sand and smooth grey rock were lined by a bale of turtles nesting and laying eggs. Farther inland, green trees filled danced in the gentle breeze. I brought the telescope up to my eyes and there in the middle of dancing trees, surrounded by rams, deers, and other grazing beasts the *Golden Fleece,* fluttered.

"We've finally done it," Jay said as we hit ship aground and everyone alighted from both sides. I quickly retrieved a bottle of whiskey from a drawer and alighted with excitement that was spread wide in a smile.

"The first one to the Golden Fleece wins." I challenge Jay who darted like an arrow towards the fleece. I giggled with joy, "I'm finally becoming the queen." I scream into the wind and run towards the Golden Fleece.

"We've finally done it," Jay bowed, "Your Highness." 

"The first one to the Golden Fleece wins." I challenged Jay, who darted like an arrow towards the fleece.
