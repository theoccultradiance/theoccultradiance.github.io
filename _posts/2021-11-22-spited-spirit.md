Renzo Napoleon was a powerful *businessman* and he was proud of what his organization, the Triads, had achieved in the millennium it had existed. He looked at his reflection in the mirror in his study, admiring the perfection of his body. Clear, tanned skin, chiseled body, and crystal blue eyes were perfected over many years. *This is what a human should look like.*

He looked closer to his reflection in the mirror-- panic rose inside him and churned his survival instinct. *No. No. No.* he looked at the strand of greying hair. He ground his teeth and smashed the mirror with his bare hands. 

"Are you alright, boss?" his associate heard the glass crashing and rushed with a gun in his hands.

Renzo looked at his associate, "Patrick," he said in an eerie, distant voice, "Roger agrees to settle his debt?" Renzo cleaned his knuckles chaffed by the broken glass. He walked across the room to the small bar, picked a bottle at the very top shelf, and poured himself a golden brown drink. *Whiskey.* he smelled it and sighed with satisfaction.

"No, boss." Patrick pocketed his gun and stood stiffly.

"Hmm." Renzo finished the drink and rose to his feet. Renzo dwarfed Patrick-- who was the strongest man working for him. His crystal blues eyes reflected the light in the room and were now a darker shade, reflecting the darkness growing inside him. He picked up an ornate knife-- the blade had a mirror-like polish and was sharp enough to cut a thin piece of paper cleanly-- and said, "Let's go." Patrick led the way towards the parked car in the garage.

Renzo sat in the back of the car remembering the fateful day a few years back. After exchanging a few attacks, his opponent had stabbed him right through his heart. Renzo remembered the sound of gurgling blood, the electrifying pain that jolted through his body, and the sharp metallic taste in his mouth. He could remember, his eyes growing heavy, the pain subsiding to a dull, annoying ache and terrible, endless darkness engulfing him.

When he woke up, Renzo recalled, he was face-to-face with his brother, "Kylo." he wanted to call, "I'm sorry." but before he could apologize for killing his brother, Renzo felt a dagger twisting in his belly.

"You are not welcome here." his brother whispered in his ears, "Go back to the mortal world."

Patrick pulled the car to a sudden stop and turned, "We are here, boss."

Renzo nodded and got off the car. He crossed the road and knocked on an intricately carved door, "Roger." he calmly said as he pounded his knuckles on the door. When the door didn't open, he signaled Patrick to break it.

"Roger." Renzo said in a sing-song voice, "It's time you paid your debt, Roger."

Renzo found Roger sitting on a chair with a gun and smiling, "It's time you died." he said and shot at Renzo's heart. Blood seeped out of the bullet wound and stained his pristine white shirt. Renzo looked at the blood and smiled, "Oh deary me." he said, "Looks like I'm going to die. Patrick, remind me, can I die?"

Patrick smiled viciously, "No, boss." Roger froze in his chair and emptied the gun in Renzo's torso, who stood in his place calmly.

"How is that possible?"

"Ah!" Renzo said, *The secret is to ignite a desire in someone's heart right before sending them to the spirit world.* "It is a secret that I cannot tell you." Renzo pinned Roger to his chair and viciously slit his throat. He signaled Patrick to tie Roger to the chair, "Allow the blood to seep out." Blood slowly flowed out of his body, turning him pale and ghostly, "See you in the spirit world." Renzo mocked him and looked in the mirror.
