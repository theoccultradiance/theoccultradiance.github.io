[WP] "Immortality was a lovely, fragile, blooming flower. It only lived alone. When it entered the weeds—when it tangled with mortal, dangerous lives, however beautiful and long-lived and perfect it was— That was how forever died."

[WP]All you wanted was a chance to study their powers, any single one of them could change the life of the common person on earth but they refuse and would rather use their powers to fight criminals and the so called "supervillains" so you will have to take them by force then.

I was foolish and naive when I left the comfort of my home to find immortality. People were always at each other's throat fighting over petty land squabble. Famine roamed the earth on his jet black stallion and I wanted to escape it all. 

I gazed upon the horizon and finally got into a crew chasing the sun at the edge of the world. With immortality, I'd said to everyone I met, I wanted to defeat the four horsemen of apocalyse and set humanity free, but the truth was, I just wanted to live and enjoy life. Maybe I'm being punished for it now.

Nothing worked, I drank wine from the Holy Grail. Climbing Mount Olympus and brew Ambrosia without a single piece of cloth on my body almost killed me. 

I scourged the North Sea in search for a tree that gave Golden Apples and lost all my friends in a storm. Once I had heard from a merchant, Gods were made immortal by drinking a wine found at the very depths of the sea. But it all failed me. 

I had grown old and tired and had given up all home to find immortality, when by a happy coincidence I found a small vial tucked nicely in a pocket of a stranger. "Immortality was a lovely, fragile, blooming flower. It only lived alone." I still remember the words clearly engraved along the side.

Without thinking what the words meant for a second, I emptied the vial in a single gulp. Yes, I've lived on ever since. But what did I lose? I lost everything. I lost the ability to be seen. I lost the ability to be loved. I lost the ability to indulge myself in pleasures of life. "Immortality was a lovely, fragile, blooming flower. It only lived alone." Now it all made sense.

I've tried to kill myself in a million different ways, but immortality was absolute. I spent decades crying alone in a cave. World around me changed at a blinding speed. World grew closer together and humans settled the outer space. 

I was missing something, every curse had a cure. I strained to recall the small vial and the writings inscribed on it, "Immortality was a lovely, fragile, blooming flower. It only lived alone." I spent days trying to complete it and it came to be in the dark of the night.

"Immortality was a lovely, fragile, blooming flower. It only lived alone. When it entered the weeds—when it tangled with mortal, dangerous lives, however beautiful and long-lived and perfect it was— That was how forever died." 

I have lived a hundred lifes, I've killed myself a million times, but today, my death will be absolute.
