Kaiser wrapped his jacket tightly around his chest and stomped his way out of the snow. *I hate snow.* he thought to himself, recalling the day he had been whipped bloody and left to die on a cold blanket of red snow. He had realized something really important that day-- *Power can wipe your sins.* Why else would a vendor walk away from almost killing a little kid.

He pushed the door of the inn and found himself an empty table, "The usual Denise," he said to the waitress without looking up. The apple merchant did get what he had deserved. A couple of years ago, Kaiser went back to the same market and tried to steal an apple from his cart and got caught. *The look on his face was amazing.* 

The vendor had forgotten about the little kid, who would have remembered an imp who was beaten bloody on a fine winter morning? The vendor tried to beat a grown-up Kaiser but before he could land a single punch, Kaiser dug a small concealed knife through the man's heart, instantly dropping him to the ground. *That was fun.*

Denise returned from the kitchen with a bowl of stew and a glass of wine, "There you go." she blushed pink and left. It was still early and the inn and the morning rush was an hour or two away. Out of habit, Kaiser looked around and ate the stew, "This is good Denise." he appreciated and Denise blushed behind the bar. 

"Kaiser?" a figure covered in a hood walked up to the table. Kaiser noted the soft, warm cloak and a gold chain around his neck and smiled. He pointed towards the chair opposite him with his head and the hooded man sat. The chair groaned under his weight, *Hmm. A rich man.*

"Whatever the task, I'll do it. Want to rob someone? I'm your man. Have a wife who needs a good fuck? I'm your man. Have a burning sensation in your loins? I'm your man. Want a ransom? I'm your man. Want to kill? I'm your man.

"It all comes with a price." Kaiser sipped the wine and waved Denise to bring more. The hooded man shifted in his chair, making up his mind whether it is safe to hire Kaiser.

"How much will it cost me to kill someone?" the hooded figure moved.

"10 Gold Shekels," Kaiser said. The hooded figure moved and fished something from his pocket and dropped it on the table with a clink. 

"5 now." the man said, "5 when you kill the man."

"Fair enough." Kaise took the pouch and pocketed it, "Who do you want to kill?"

"Galramdur." 

"Where will I find him?"

He'll be in the market today," the man dug again in his pocket and produced a sketch from it.

Kaiser picked up the crumpled paper and looked at the man. He had a long pointy beard and hat that hadn't been in fashion for a long time. The sketch was rudimentary but he found something disturbing about the target. He memorized the face and ripped it into pieces and swallowed it, "You can leave."

*Remember to be careful.* Kaiser could still hear his master, the man who taught him how to steal and how to kill. *I owe everything to you master.* Kaiser could never forget the day when he was whipped. 

His master found him unconscious in the middle of the market and nurtured him to health, "Kaiser," he would say, "the world is brutal and the only way to survive is to be a savage." he offered him a small knife. 

Kaiser continued to walk wander in the street, his face covered in the shadow of his hood. Kaiser had traveled all of Erdenia and every village he went to, it was the same. A market in the center, farmers toiling in the sun, vendors ripping the customers off, the alderman lining their pockets and poor street urchins like Kaiser were whipped bloody by the steelers.

Kaiser saw a steeler pass by pulled his hood further over his head. The market of this particular village was one of the bigger ones. Being on the Erdenian highway, this village enjoyed tired travelers who would be ripped off by the locals. 

Kaiser found a spot between two buildings that were covered in darkness and waited patiently for his target. The hooded man had said, Galramdur would be in the market at noon. He was early so he decided to circle the market and accustom himself of all the paths that would lead him away from the scene, "Always know the world around you, Kaiser. It'll prove to be useful wheescapemake an escape."

He found an urchin lurking behind a barrel waiting to steal apples from a cart and Kaiser shook his head, *He'll be beaten to death if he gets caught.* he continued monitoring the market and returned to his shadowed spot. Kaiser looked up to the sky, *it is almost noon.*

Galramdur walked into the market from the street across him. *I wonder what did he do?* Kaiser noted the man's small frame and thin body, *He doesn't look menacing. He's even smiling.* "Always observe little things your target did. It'll help you understand them better and in turn kill them." he heard his master's voice. 

Galramdur approached the apple merchant and was making charming conversation with the merchant. He pulled out a bronze shekel and bought an apple from the merchant and continued towards the butcher who was selling freshly slaughtered lamb. *He doesn't look rich or powerful or influential.* Kaiser noted his clothes and the way he carried himself. The rich and influential walked around with their heads held high and looked down at everything that crossed their path.

*I think I'm ready.* Kaiser nodded to himself and walked towards Galramdur swiftly dropping his knife from his sleeve. Even though he had killed many, every time he walked up to his target his heart thumped furiously inside him. Kaiser was about to stab the man's flanks when Galramdur turned around on his heels and smiled.

Kaiser tried to stab the man but his whole body froze. *What is happening?* he panicked.

"Kaiser," Galramdur spoke. *How does he know my name? What is his doing with his fingers?* "Came here to murder me? You fool." Galramdur touched Kaiser's shoulders and powerful energy coursed through him numbing his body, almost killing him. 

"Son," Galramdur said with a solemn expression, "You cannot touch me! Go back to the alderman who paid you to kill me and tell him, I'll burn him to ashes if he tries to interfere with my work again." Galramdur tapped and Kaiser dropped to his knees. Galramdur spun on his heels and continued to walk away.

"Oh," he spoke over his shoulders, "This village is mine, you and alderman better leave it by sunrise tomorrow." he smiled and disappeared around a corner.

"Who was that man?" Kaiser pressed the cold metal blade against the alderman's throat.

"Galramdur." the alderman shook underneath Kaiser's knife, "I already told you."

"What did he do to me?" Kaiser shouted, "I couldn't move a single finger. He touched my shoulders and a jolt of electricity coursed through me. Who is that man?"

"He's a mage." the alderman said, "He's trying to undermine everything I do. Do you know how much I lost since he walked into this village? One thousand shekels."

"A mage?" Kaiser pulled the blade away and let alderman free, "You mean someone who can do magic?"

"Yes." 

"That can't be true. There's no such thing as magic."

Alderman rubbed his neck to see if he bled, "I thought you traveled all of Erdenia. Didn't you find a single mage in all those big cities?" 

True, Kaiser had traveled all of Erdenia, but he had visited villages and hamlets-- some built along with the road others so far off into the woods he'd stumble into them by accident.

"They make them somewhere in Yerden-- the capital." Alderman said. 

"Power," Kaiser heard his master, "You must always strive for more power. The more powerful you become, the more control you'll have over the world around you. No one will insult you. No one will hurt you. No one will beat you bloody and leave you to die." *Magic? That'll make me powerful.* Kaiser had made up his mind, he was going to be a mage.
