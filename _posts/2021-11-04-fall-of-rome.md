Prompt: 

The whole city of Rome just up and disappears one day. We don’t know where it went. It’s not there anymore. Roads leading into the city simply turn to dust as you drive on them. Every person who lived there is gone.

The emperor heard the ground bellow in rage. The building rattled and debris fell from above. The Royal guard formed a turtle like structure with their shields and protected their liege. The Roman Emperor went to his knees in a prayer, "Dear Lord," he prayed to his New God, "I pray for Your protection. You are my hiding place and under your wings I can always find refuge."

The Royal guards closed, their shields protected the Emperor from falling debris. Outside, Emperor heard terrible thunderclap mixed with the agonizing screams of his subjects. The earth beneath his shook and the guards struggled to maintain the defensive structure. The Palace floor ruptured and exposed the floors below. Emperor peeped and saw boiling magma rising quickly.

"Dear Lord," the Emperor whispered, "Protect me from trouble wherever I go."

The ground stopped shaking and the magma below recided, Emperor smiled raising the cross he wore around his neck and kissed it reverently. The guards broke their stance and the emperor went to the nearby window. A tempestuous thunderstorm engulfed the palace. Lightening cracked and shattered the sky into many fragments and a angry gale blew shattering the very bricks of his palace. The emperor narrowed his eyes, *Dear Lord.* the emperor went pale. 

Everything that defined Rome, the palace, the streets, the Colosseum, the Pantheon, the people of Rome floated amidst a raging tempest. The Lightening bolts that cracked were not the usual electric blue instead they were a blood red that turned black at the edges. "What is happening?" the Emperor asked to no one in particular, "Dear Lord, save me, save my people from evil."

A lightening bolt struck the palace hurling debris into the tempest. Emperor heard a shrill whistle of an eagle intertwined with a neigh and a faint hiss. Moments later, the three Gods the Emperor of Rome had given up appeared. Their eyes were filled with rage and their faces twisted with hate and contempt. 

"Dear Lord." the Emperor held the cross tightly between his fingers, "Fill me ith your Holy Presence. Let me rest and be at peace. Let me feel your protection. I pray, my Lord, please take my fear away and give me peace."

Zeus' eyes glowed electric blue like a bolt of lightening, "I'm your Lord and you-- along with your subjects-- shall stay in the pits of Tartarus for an eternity." Zeus raised his hands and shot a lightening bolt across the palace stabbing him in the heart. The Emperor felt his heart stop, darkness engulfed him, "Am I dead?" he said with fear in his voice.
