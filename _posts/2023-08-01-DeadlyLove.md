Love sat in front of the mirror, admiring the various identities it had acquired. It became a young woman with flowing locks of blonde hair and in the next a handsome man with chiseled muscles. Love admired them all. Love loved them all. Love assumed the identity of a middle-aged man with balding hair and an ordinary personality when he heard a knock on his door, "In a minute." he faked the man's voice.

"Prime," Love opened the door with a nervous look. It bowed low in respect.

The man at the door had a proud demeanor around him. He observed Love with keen, calculating eyes forcing Love to shuffle on his feet, "Mr..." Prime waited for the middle-aged Love to interject.

"Gordy." Love added.

"Mr. Gordy," Prime walked inside with his hands clasped behind his back, "I've heard a lot about you."

Love swallowed, *What did he hear about me?* "I'm, but an ordinary man, Prime. I'm sure you must be thinking of someone else." Love said with fear lingering in its voice. *They'll hunt me down and kill me like they did to my kind.*

"I know exactly who you are," Prime said without looking at Love's identity, Gordy.

"Prime." Gordy bowed low.

"I have a task for you, hashish." Prime turned to face him.

Gordy sighed, "How do you know?"

"I'm the Prime of Azeca," he said with pride, "It is my business to know who's in Azeca." Prime held Gordy in his gaze and waited patiently.

Gordy chuckled and assumed the identity of a young woman, the kind Prime was known to like, and said in a sweet, seductive voice, "What do you want me to do?"

Prime ogled at the young woman before shaking his head to clear his thoughts, "I want you to kill the Mage King."

"He's the most powerful mage," the young woman said, "It's not possible to kill him."

"I know what you are capable of hashish." 

Love assumed the identity of a wise old man and spoke in a confident voice, "I'm tired of living my life on the run. I want to be appointed as Lord of Artiza."

Prime nodded, "It'll be done. You have my word."

There are many ways to kill a human, Love had learned as a young hashish. *Stab him, burn her, poison them.* it remembered its master speaking, *But they'll always find out who did it.* Love poured a thick, translucent liquid into a cauldron and brought it to a boil. *Our abilities make us special. We can kill them without staining our own hands.*

Love added a pinch of herb it had grown in its backyard and the boiling liquid turned a rich dark gold-- almost brown. *Say what you may, master, the blood will always be on our hands.*  Carefully, it transferred the dark golden liquid into a bottle and sealed it shut with a cork.

*The best way to kill someone...* Love wondered as it shuffled through its various identities, finding one most suitable for a task. *This won't work...* it thought in its own voice when it looked at the image of an exotic girl from the West. *This won't work.* it shuffled again, but the voice in its thoughts was always his own. 

After an hour of shuffling through a hundred or so different identities Love had stolen, Love settled for a beautiful woman with velvety smooth skin and bright blue eyes. It admired the gentle curls of her hair and firm breasts and a flat stomach. The woman had a distinct quality that would instantly make her the center of attraction.

*She'll work fine.* Love thought staring at her image in the mirror. *Janna.* Love said the name to remember it. Janna went out and all eyes were on her as she closed the door behind. *Yes. She'll work fine.* Love thought.

"Janna," The Mage King whispered, "Please," he begged in a tremulous voice.

"My King," Janna leaned and kissed the Mage King with a deep, dark passion, "We'll be together, forever."

The effect of Love's potion was strong and didn't seem to wear off. The Mage King, the strongest wizard on the planet fell for it. *Love is deadly.* Love thought.

"Janna," The Mage King took the knife from her hand, "I love you."

"My king," Janna smiled smothering the Mage King's infatuated heart, "I know."

The Mage King smiled and slowly slit his throat, blood gurgling from his mouth and pooling around him as darkness engulfed him, "I'll be waiting." he said as he drew his final breath.

Love shuffled through its identities and acquired one of a wise old man. He walked across the room and sat on the massive chair and graciously crossed his legs. His eyes darted across the room as he saw the massacre of Mage King. The corpses of the Mage king of Azeca and his dynasty lay in a pool of blood. 

*Love will kill you in the end.*
