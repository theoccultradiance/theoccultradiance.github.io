The ground beneath Vandar quaked, his vision was slowly returning and he stabbed his long sword in the ground to gain some footing. *What...* Vandar shook his head. The last thing Vandar could remember was seeing a violet shadow veil the moon. *Violet Moon.* 

Straining, Vandar peered up to the sky and saw silver clouds covering the white ball. *Violet Moon...* Vandar's chuckle stopped in his throat when he saw the ground around him. 

Thousands of corpses freckled the brown earth. At a distance, Vandar saw a kettle of vultures circling the sky, waiting for the injured to die. A putrid stench of bloodied corpses and soiled armor hit him hard. Still supporting himself on the long sword, Vandar covered his nose with gauntleted hands. *Did I win?* he wondered as he scanned the battlefield.

*There.* Vandar saw a flag-- attached to a spear-- fluttering in the gentle breeze that swept the stench of the battlefield towards Vandar. *Gold background, Crescent Moon.* Vandar instantly recognized his flag. The banner of his forefathers of the House of Lunos. Vandar sighed in relief and started towards the dancing flag.

*Thanks to the Violet Moon...* Vandar winced in pain, *I'm the Emperor to all of Ganya.* Vandar made up his mind to change the color of his flag from Gold and Crescent Moon to Black and Violet Moon. *I'll be known as the Violet King of Ganya.* 

"Ahhhh." Someone moaned in pain and Vandar stopped. A man lay on the ground cradling his spilled guts, "Please. Please put it back in." he cried, "I don't want to die, I want to live, see my daughter grow into a beautiful lady." 

Vandar knelt beside the man and ran his hand through the man's head, "Soldier," Vandar said in a soft, yet commanding voice, "You've done great service to the House of Lunos. Because of your sacrifice, the House of Lunos will bring peace and order to all of Ganya. Rest, now!" Vandar slowly slid his side dagger into the man's heart. His eyes widened momentarily before they lost their glitter.

Vandar continued to walk towards the Golden beacon when he heard a voice carried over to him from his right. He craned his neck and saw a figure running towards him. Long black hair glittered under the moonlight, "Vandar." the voice called again, "Vandar." 

"Here," Vandar answered back with a smile. *Empress of Ganya.* Vandar took Lorenya into an embrace. The smell of her hair swept the stench of the battlefield away. Vandar stayed in her embrace a little longer, allowing her warmth to soothe his tired bones. 

"Thank god," tears swelled in Lorenya's eyes, "Thank God you are alive. They all went mad. They attacked each other, stabbing, hacking, screaming. They killed each other. I ran. I ran away from the camp." Lorenya dropped the sword that she was caring for and wept.

"It is alright," Vandar said raising her head and wiping the tears off her face, "You are the Empress of Ganya."

"What?" Lorenya looked up at him.

"We won." Vandar pointed towards the Golden banner, "House of Lunos rules all of Ganya."

"Vandar," Lorenya wiped the tears, "Oh, sweet Vandar. We didn't win."

"But the battle is over." Vandar raised an eyebrow, "My Banner is standing tall."

"Vandar," Lorenya said, "We lost everything. Everyone we've ever loved, cared for, or hated. The Violet Moon didn't give men the power to be conquerors. The Violet Moon drove men into Bloodlust."

"What do you mean?"

"Look closely Vandar," Lorenya said, "The corpses are of enemies and allies. Everyone is dead, Vandar. Our son, our daughter, your brother..."

"It can't..." Vandar found words choked in his throat, he freed his hands from the long sword and spun around in a circle, scanning the field of corpses, "The Violet Moon... I wanted to make this world a better place to live in... But instead, I made it devoid of life... What have I done? Why did I make the Moon turn Violet? What have I done Lorenya?"

"Vandar," Lorenya, "Stay strong. We need to rebuild Ganya."

"I..." Vandar wiped his tears, "All of Ganya?"

"Yes," Lorenya put her hand on Vandar's shoulder, "All of Ganya is wiped out... Millions dead in mere minutes..."

"Blood of Millions..." Vandar choked, "Blood of Millions is on my hands..."

"We," Lorenya said in a comforting voice, "will make this right. We'll rebuild Ganya."
