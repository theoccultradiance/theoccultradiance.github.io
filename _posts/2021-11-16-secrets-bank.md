Prompt: 

You run a secrets bank. For a nominal fee, people can come in, deposit their secrets, and forget about them for a certain period of time.

John lit another cigarette within the bank premises. He had been working for the Secrets Bank for over a decade now and yet everything about it still surprised him. The walls were lofty, reaching almost 40 feet in height. Various paintings created by masters who would never be forgotten adorned the beige walls. John tilted his head to look at the carvings on the pillar and was astonished by how different they looked at this angle. 

"I need to make a deposit!" a scrawny young man walked up to his desk. He looked nervous and fidgeted with the button ripped from his shirt.

"Name?" John said smashing the butt of the cigarette in the ashtray and lighting another.

"Do I need a name?" The scrawny man said, "I thought this isn't a legitimate bank." 

"We are not!" John said shrugging, "But we need a man's name."

"Forget it." He turned to leave but saw something-- someone-- and decided against it, "Name's Mike."

"Mike." John engraved it on a piece of a tin can and handed it over to Mike, "Put whatever you want to in that tin can. How long do you want it to hold for us?"

Mike took the tin can from John's hand and gave placed the button he had been fidgetting inside the tin can. *I must forget everything.* he thought with a solemn look on his face, *I'm sorry Ann, I had to do this to protect you.* He wrapped his fingers tightly around the tin can and recalled everything that defined him. His entire life flashed in front of his eyes, the day his brother was born, the day his mother died, the day he met Ann, the day he got his first promotion, the day he had a daughter... Every beautiful moment that had made him the man he was flashed in his mind.

"Are you done?" John sighed taking a large drag from the cigarette. Mike handed the tin can back to him and John continued with his paperwork, "What secret are you placing in the deposit?"

"What's the point of telling you?" Mike looked confused.

"Look, it is not easy to explain but that is how it works. I need to seal your secret in this tin can with a secret to my own. I don't have enough secrets of my own to cater to every customer who walks in through that door. That's why I take your secret and make it my own."

"Okay." Mike thought for a moment, "I'm placing my entire life in the deposit!"

John measured up the scrawny man, "Are you sure? You'll forget everything, you'll forget every loved one in your life. Hell, you'll forget how to speak."

Mike nodded, *That is exactly what I'm trying to do. I'm sorry Ann, this is for you and Murphy.* 

"Up to you." John etched some ancient runes on the tin can, "I'm just a teller." He placed the lid back on the can and whispered something under his breath. A gentle glow illuminated his face and the can seal itself shut. John looked at Mike who looked around the world with confusion. He sighed and called the security, "Take him out." He lit another cigarette, "Be gentle, the man deposited his life with us."
