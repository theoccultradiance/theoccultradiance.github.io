Prompt: 

A world in which the things people say takes on physical form
-->

He didn't have a name, like many of his kind, people just called him Omega-13. He stood behind a tree, shaded by the wide, green branches, and waited. His heart skipped and he felt anxious and afraid but weirdly he felt happy too. At a distance he finally saw her, walking gracefully with an umbrella protecting her golden skin. She walked delicately towards him and he could feel his lips curling into a wide, gleeful smile. She was tall-- three heads taller than Omega-13 and her slender waist was as wide as his stump-like legs. Nothing seemed more delicate and more beautiful to Omega-13 than Lisa. *She's... Words cannot define her.*

"Lisa," he said in a heavy, gravelly voice that didn't suit his short physique. He offered her his hand and she grabbed it and together they went into the woods away from scornful eyes.

"I've finally decided a name for you," she said when they were in the middle of a small clearly-- a beautiful glade filled with bushes and flowers they had discovered a few months back. He took off his shirt and lay flat on the ground. The sun bathed his red skin. Lisa ran her golden fingers over his taut red skin unattentively, "What are you going to call me?" Omega-13 said in a gravelly voice.

Lisa looked at him, her green eyes caught the sunlight and Omega-13 thought he could see the whole world in it, "Prem." 

"What does it mean?" he asked.

"It means love," Lisa said throwing her head across his chest. He wrapped his hands around her and pulled her up and kissed her. Prem felt a sensation of thrill and excitement course through him the broke the boring existence of his life. With Lisa, the differences of their race, the color of their skin didn't matter. They made love in the glade they had discovered and lay entwined on the ground basking in the sunlight. 

"What was that?" Prem sounded alarmed. Angry footsteps and clanking metal approached the glade and within a few heartbeats, they were surrounded by soldiers in golden armor.

"Lisa." a man said in a fatherly voice, "Thank god you are safe. Arrest that bastard, it tried to rape my child."

"No father." Lisa said standing protectively in front of Prem, "I love this man."

"It is a filthy red Omega." father said in a contemptuous voice. A soldier dragged her towards her father and bounded Prem in chains. The soldier kicked him across his face and a tooth fell off Prem's mouth, "Lisa, my child. I hope you are safe." the father embraced her and dragged her out of the woods.

"Piece of shit." a soldier pushed Prem. 

"Stinking Omega." another kicked him. Lisa looked over his shoulders and found Prem dragged across the ground. 

"Take that." an armored soldier stoned him, cracking open his skull.

"Keep walking Lisa." the father said, "It is a dangerous thing. It'll enchant you."

"Stop calling him *it*." Lisa said, "He has a name."

"What is it called?" father asked the soldier to mock Lisa.

A soldier pulled Prem's head and opened his mouth to see the tattoo under his tongue, "Omega-13"

"That Omega-13 has enchanted you with black magic my little girl." the father said, "We'll take you to the church and free you from its spell."

"He has a name," Lisa said, something inside her was cracking.

"Drink this." a soldiered undid his pants and pissed on Prem. Lisa's eyes filled with disgust and the embers of anger raged into a wildfire. She felt disgusted by her people, by her father. She felt disgusted at how they treated a man who looked different from them.

"He has a name." Lisa said with a force that chilled the golden soldiers to their bones, "His name is Prem." she walked towards him and cradled his head in her lap. Her father looked at her with horror and ordered the soldiers to pull her away from Prem. "You are disgusting," her anger armored her words. Her anger fueled her words with magic-- dark and terrible, known only to her predecessors, "You all deserve to die." Her voice was thunderous and terrible. In a heartbeat, the golden soldiers, her father burst into flames and died.

"No one will ever take you away from me," Lisa said cleaning Prem up with a piece of cloth she tore off from her dress.
