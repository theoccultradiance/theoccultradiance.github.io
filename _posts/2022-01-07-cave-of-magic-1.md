Kaiser was small-- living off scrapes had such an effect on the human body. Orphaned when he was just a babe suckling at mother's teat, Kaiser had managed to find himself a home-- a small place next to a chimney that he had covered with ragged clothes and blankets thrown away by the rich. Agreed, it was small, but it was warm and had all the things he owned. A small warm blanket, a wooden horse someone had cast away, and rocks of different shapes filled his little home.

It had snowed last night, and thanks to the people living in the house, he was warm. He twisted in a bed of dried grass-- that he had smuggled out of a barn-- and peeked outside the tent. 

The village was covered in white, pristine snow. The villagers moved in the sheet of white to begin their day on the field or in the market. Kaiser saw a vendor push his cart through the white, leaving a trail of tire marks on the smooth cover. His stomach growled when he saw the delicious red apples glitter in the sun. *They look so delicious.* his mouth watered, and he crawled off the tent.

Carefully Kaiser dropped in the alley below and tailed the vendor. The oversized boots that he had found lying in a gutter made it difficult for him to walk in the ankle-deep snow, *ugh.* he sighed in frustration. His toes were freezing in the cold, and he was hungry. When Kaiser looked up from his toes, the vendor had vanished in the street ahead. 

Kaiser grunted and trudged along the snowy road, "What are you doing here?" he heard someone call, and Kaiser hid behind two boxes. "Where did that insolent urchin disappear?" he heard his pursuer shout angrily. *He is always following me.* he thought as he snuck out from his spot and continued his long, painful walk towards the market.

Usually, by this time, the market bustled with activity. Vendors wanted to sell their products by sundown, and the customers wanted to get a good deal. Kaiser looked around the market square and found only a couple of hawkers with their carts waiting for a passing customer. 

Kaiser hid between two buildings and patiently waited for an opening, *hmm,* Kaiser thought to himself, *These must be the rich merchants. They are wearing warm jackets. and look at their shoes, they look warm and comfortable.* The day went along, and a few villagers circled the market, purchasing apples, figs, meat, and milk. 

Kaiser looked for the apple vendor and found his cart left unattended. He had an opening. He found strength in his feet and tiptoed towards the cart. His legs had gone numb by now, and his knuckles were black from cold. He walked in the shadows of the buildings with his back against their walls. He crouched as he approached the cart.

Quickly scanning his environment, he shoved his hands in the cart and picked an apple. He fished for another when he felt a massive hand on his shoulders. The vendor had returned and had caught him stealing, "You fucking imp." he slapped Kaiser across the face. 

A small crowd, a crowd of rich merchants had gathered, "This urchin was stealing from my cart." the apple vendor announced, "he deserves to be punished." the vendor kicked him in the stomach, and Kaiser felt the air leave his lungs. A swinging stick found Kaiser's shin and cracked it. A jolt of pain should have coursed through his body, but the cold had numbed his sensations.

Seeing the angry crowd a steeler whistled. "What is going on here?" Kaiser had little strength to move, but he saw a steeler, wearing a royal blue uniform and carrying a small, steel baton walk into the scene.

"This boy stole my apples," the apple merchant kicked Kaiser in the face who had balled up in the snow, shivering in the cold. 

"Ah." the steeler smiled, and Kaiser heard the whip, "he must be whipped." After an excruciating 5 minutes of whipping, the vendors dispersed leaving him balled up in the red snow. Tears froze, and Kaiser struggled to get up. The cold had crept up his joints, and he found it difficult to move. *I'm going to die here.*
